🏥 Hospital Data Analysis (SQL Project)

📌 Project Overview

This project uses SQL to analyze hospital data and uncover insights about patients, admissions, doctors, and regions. The goal is to show how structured queries can turn raw hospital records into useful information that supports better healthcare decisions.

🎯 Objectives

Analyze patient demographics (age, gender, unique names).

Study admission patterns by day, month, and season.

Measure doctor performance and specialty workloads.

Identify repeat diagnoses and average length of stay.

Compare patient volumes across cities and provinces.


🗂 Dataset

The database consists of four main tables:

Patient – patient details, demographics, allergies.

Doctor – doctor information and specialties.

Admission – admission and discharge records.

Province_Names – province-level mapping for patients.


🔍 Key SQL Queries

Count of patients born in a specific year.

Same-day admission and discharge records.

Gender distribution of patients.

Repeat admissions by diagnosis.

Patient-to-doctor ratio by province.

Admissions by season and by day of month.

Top doctors by unique patient reach.

Average length of stay by diagnosis.


📊 Insights

1. 55 patients were born in 2010, with a balanced male-to-female ratio.


2. Admissions were steady across seasons: Summer (92), Spring (92), Fall (91), Winter (90).


3. Top doctors – Dr. Claude (Internist) treated 212 unique patients, and Dr. Angelica (Nuclear Medicine) treated 206.


4. Repeat admissions suggest chronic illnesses, with stay length varying by diagnosis.


5. Hamilton had the most patients (1,938), much higher than Toronto (317).



💡 Recommendations

Improve children’s care and vaccination programs.

Keep staffing consistent all year.

Distribute workload among doctors, especially in busy specialties.

Provide follow-ups to reduce repeat admissions.

Add more staff and resources in Hamilton to handle high demand.


⚙ Tools Used

SQL (MySQL) for data analysis

GitHub for version control


🚀 Future Scope

Build interactive dashboards for real-time monitoring.

Use predictive analytics to forecast admissions.

Expand dataset with billing, lab results, and medication details.
